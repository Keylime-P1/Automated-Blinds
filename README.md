# Automated-Blinds
This is the code that went into automating window blinds.
The initial theory was developed in python to understand how to track and limit motor rotation. 
The program was then finished in arduino ide to include a stepper motor and IR sensor.
The python code is purely for legacy reasons and to understand the learning experience. The arduino code is the one used in the application of the project
